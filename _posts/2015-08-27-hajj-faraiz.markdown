- We are doing Hajj Tamattu

- Re-enter state of Ihram with Ghusal, Salat and Talbiyah whilst in Aziziyah
- Pack up!! You will need a few essentials:
    - Bag for stones (can use a water bottle too)
    - Bed sheet for ground
    - Inflatable pillow
    - Tissue rolls
    - Soap
    - Towel
    - Quran
    - Dua book

- Day 1(8 dul hajj)
     - Heading to Mina (mustahib to pray 5 prayers [Zuhr, Asr, Maghrib, Isha and Fajr] there) (best to reach before Zuhr)
     - You might be taken there a day before, so you can return and spend the night of 7th Zul Hajj in Aziziyah, and then walk to Mina in the morning.
     - In Mina, try to avoid taking the corner beds, especially one in front of the door.
     - Farz prayers are shortened from 4 to 2 rakahs
     - You might leave for Arafat the night of 8th as well, if possible try leaving around / after Fajr so you can rest that night properly.

- Day 2 (9 dul hajj)
     - Arafat - Pack up. Leave after Fajr, need to reach before Zuhr.
     - Wuquf (from Zuhr to Maghrib)
     - It is recommended to stand and make dua (outside recommended) during this period. Between Asr and Maghrib is the important period, must make dua during this time.
     - Make tasbih of 100 for the following:  3rd Kalimah, 4th Kalimah, 1st Kalimah, Durood, and Surah e Iklas. One should beg for forgiveness like a fussy child.
     - DO NOT PERFRM MAGHRIB - combined with isha performed in Muzdalifa
     - Muzalifah - pray Maghrib and Isha farz in group following rest of the prayers
     - Sunnat is to sleep, this is a night more important than Lailatul Qadr.

- Day 3 (10 dul hajj)
     - Wuquf of Muzdalifa (Fajr to sunrise) - make Dua.
     - back to Mina after Sunrise (Recite talbiyah)
     - in Mina you now have __4 major responsibilities__ [Order is important]:
        - going to the Jamarat (area of pelting) to pelt the large shaytan  (sun rise to duhr - Sunnah, best before Maghrib [Recommended to do after Asr when traffic is less])
            - Pelting Procedure:
                - Make your way to the end of the pillar (do not throw the stones yet).
                - Take out the stones in your hand, important not to throw all of them at once, it is counted as one Rumi then.
                - Stand in front of the wall that represents the large Shaytan and throw seven pebbles, one at a time, at this wall.
                - Each pebble should be held between the index finger and thumb of the right hand and thrown, with your hand at the level of your head, while reciting “Bismillahi Allahu Akbar” each time.
                - After final stone it is end of hajj (stop reciting talbiyah)
        - Sacrificing an animal (done by organizer, you need to let them know when you will go for Rami so they can do it accordingly)
        - Shaving the head or cutting the hair
        - Performing Tawaf Ziyarah with sa’ee. Tawaf Ziyarah and the sa’ee of Hajj can be performed anytime from the beginning of the time of Fajr on the 10th of Dhul Hijjah until sunset on the 12th. This can also be done together with Tawaf e Wida.
        - For Tawaf e Ziyarat I performed it on the mid-night of the second day and it was not very busy. There was loads of space on first and second level inner circles and the outer circles were relatively empty.
     - Sunnah to Return to Mina (according to your plan)

- Day 4,5,6- 11th,12th,13th Dhul hajj
     - Rami to be performed on this day. All three Jamarat will be pelted in order (small, then middle, and then large). See above for procedure
     - Small - pelt turn towards Kabah, make dua
     - Middle - pelt turn towards Kabah, make dua
     - Large - pelt, no dua - return (follow the correct path to your Maktab)
     - During the day you can also visit Azizyah for a shower and some rest if needed.

- Day 6 is optional, can be missed if you leave at Day 5 before Maghrib.
     Tawaf-e-Wida any time after Tawaf-e-ziyarah, No Ihram necessary. Final ritual of hajj
     - Umrah, Nafl TAWAF etc are allowed after the farewell TAWAF.
