- Wear your ID badge at all times (given to you after you arrive in Jeddah / Makkah).
- Focus on the task at hand (i.e. if doing Tawaf think about its faraiz)
- No need to hurry or rush at any point
- Wear Ihram at home but do not make Niyat until after take off. Can also wear the Ihram in flight.
- Talbiya is the most important prayer.
- Make sure all luggage has your name tag, maktab (you will get it in Makkah) and address
- Take some snacks with you when travelling (buscuits, chips, water)
- Medicine needs to be packed and stamped by officials
- Keep multiple copies of your passport and ID
- Hajarat Azwat and Muntazilm may be scented so best not to touch it during the state of Ihram
