- Wear your ID badge at all times (given to you after you arrive in Jeddah / Makkah).
- No need to hurry or rush at any point. You should not be worried about getting left behind. This is especially important for Rami since everybody wants to rush off to it, the later hours have less traffic.
- Wear Ihram at home but do not make Niyat until after take off. Can also wear the Ihram in flight.
- Talbiya is the most important prayer.
- Learn the following either before or during the travels: 3rd Kalimah, 4th Kalimah, Dua after Azaan, Dua for Witr and Dua for funeral prayer.
- In Masjid Haram, after almost every prayer there is a funeral prayer, wait for a minute or two and then join in. Pray Sunnat and Nafl after.
- Make sure all luggage has your name tag, maktab (you will get it in Makkah) and address
- Take some snacks with you when travelling (buscuits, chips, water)
- Medicine needs to be packed and stamped by officials before leaving. Keep the essentials. There are free clinics in Mina which give medicine.
- Keep multiple copies of your passport and ID
- Hajarat Azwat and Muntazilm may be scented so best not to touch it during the state of Ihram
- When going for Juma prayer in Madinah, Makkah or Azizyah before the days of Hajj, leave at least 2 hours before the prayer and make sure to keep a prayer rug and water with you.
- If you are planning to go for Jumma to Alharam close to the days of Hajj, best to leave at or right after Fajr. You might then be able to get inside the mosque.
- In Masjid ul Haram, do not try leaving right before or after prayers. It is very crowded during the Hajj days. Waiting 15 mins can make a huge difference.
- Make sure to revise your notes before going to perform a task (i.e. Tawaf). Once there, there is too much happening to take the notes out.
