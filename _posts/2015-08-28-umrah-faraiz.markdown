- Reaching Makkah
    - Landing at Jeddah airport, bus to Makkah.
    - On departing the plane, put ur bags in trolley, given back at Pakistan desk
    - Passports are taken from you at desk.
    - Several hours wait can be expected at the airport

- After arriving in Makkah, no need to do Umrah right away, you may rest.
- First sighting of the Kaaba is important, make sure you enter the mosque looking down and are ready with your prayers on sighting. (Stand aside when doing so)
- Best prayer at this point is to ask for all upcoming prayers to be answered.
- Before starting Tawaf check time, Tawaf should not be disrupted by prayer. If you have arrived late in evening (after Maghrib) best to rest until sunrise.

     - Ramal: 3 rounds, walk fast
     - Do 7 rounds and Istilam at end, no Talbiya, preferred 3rd Kalmah or Subhanallah. Can be quiet too. After Muntazilm (last corner before Hajar-e-Azwat) pray Rabbana Attina.
     - 2 Nafl (behind Maqam Ibrahim preferred)
