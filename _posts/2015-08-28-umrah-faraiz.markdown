- Reaching Makkah
    - Landing at Jeddah airport, bus to Makkah.
    - On departing the baggage claim area, put ur bags in the trollies, given back at your countries desk
    - Passports are taken from you at desk, or when boarding the bus.
    - Several hours wait can be expected at the airport, and during the journey, it took us about 3 hours to get out of the airport, and about 7 hours to reach our hotel in Makkah.

- After arriving in Makkah, no need to do Umrah right away, you may rest.
- Best time to do Tawaf is at midnight (during Hajj days). The upper mattaf is emptier than lower ones (usually). Most enjoyable one is on the roof (at night).
- First sighting of the Kaaba is important, make sure you enter the mosque looking down and are ready with your prayers on sighting. (Stand aside when doing so)
- Best prayer at this point is to ask for all upcoming prayers to be answered.
- Before starting Tawaf check time, Tawaf should not be disrupted by prayer. If you have arrived late in evening (after Maghrib) best to rest until sunrise. You may however pray Farz if a prayer starts during the Tawaf.

- Tawaf
     - Niyat just before reaching the line / light (green blubs)
     - Istibah: Men cover only one shoulder
     - Istakbal: Face and chest towards Hajar-e-Azwat. Raise hands to ear lobes and recite Allahu akbar
     - Istilam: Raise hands towards Hajar-e-Azwat, prayer and then kiss your palms.
     - Ramal: 3 rounds, walk fast (not compulsory)
     - Do 7 rounds and Istilam at end, no Talbiya, preferred 3rd Kalmah or Subhanallah. Can be quiet too. After Muntazilm (last corner before Hajar-e-Azwat) pray Rabbana Attina.
     - 2 Nafl (behind Maqam Ibrahim preferred)
     - Drink Zamzam
     - Do Istilam before heading off to Saee
- Saee
     - Niyaat
     - 7 lengths between Safa and Marwa, dua at each point
     - Men walk fast between green lights
     - No Istilam
     - No loud prayers
- Haircut
     - 1 inch all around the head, or shave
