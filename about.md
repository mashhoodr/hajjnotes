### About

My name is Mashhood Rastgar and I am a software developer based in Karachi, Pakistan. I am a partner in a web consultancy named [Marketlytics](http://marketlytics.com). This site contains the notes I have made for my trip to Hajj in the year of 2015. I found most of the content on the web was very verbose and needed something shorter in point format which I could revise quickly before each action. While the notes are for people going to Hajj from Pakistan, most of the Faraiz should apply to everyone. Feel free to copy them over or generate pull requests if you want to add to them.

Thanks!
